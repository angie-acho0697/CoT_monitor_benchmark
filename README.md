> **TL;DR**: Analysis of existing benchmarks for measuring Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring uplift in AI safety. Identifies critical gaps and research opportunities for detecting AI sabotage through reasoning trace monitoring.

## 🎯 Research Question

**How much safety benefit do we gain from monitoring AI models' reasoning traces (CoT) compared to only monitoring their actions?**

This "CoT uplift" metric is crucial for:
- 🚀 Informing deployment decisions for AI systems  
- 🔬 Guiding research priorities (CoT monitoring vs. neuralese-robust methods)
- 📢 Advocacy and policy recommendations
- ⚠️ Understanding the fragility of current safety measures
